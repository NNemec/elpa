This directory contains tar-balls of different Versions of the ELPA library.
At the moment these tar-balls are only available via the ELPA git repository,
but this might change in the future. Since the tar-balls represent a snapshot
of the ELPA git repository the naming is the following:

ELPA_VERSION_year_month_day_of_tarball_creation.tar.gz
