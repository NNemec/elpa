This file contains the release notes for the ELPA 2016.05.001 version

What is new?
-------------
For changes since release ELPA 2015.11.011 please have a loog at the Changelog file


a) ABI change
---------------------

Most importantly, the ABI of the ELPA library changed!
New interfaces have been added, the old ones still exists, thus a rebuild
of your code (build with ELPA 2015.11.001) should not be necessary. However,
it is not guaranteed whether your Fortran compiler produces compatible
Fortran modules if content is added to this modules. To be on the safe sight,
re-compiling your application with the new ELPA version is not a bad idea.

For details of the ABI changes (including the history of changes) please have a
look at the "LIBRARY_INTERFACE" file

Any incompatibilities to previous version?
---------------------------------------

As mentioned before, the ABI of ELPA was changed such, that there should be no
incompatibility with the previous version ELPA 2015.11.001. There is an
incompatibility with older versions than ELPA 2015.11.001 !
