Welcome to the ELPA library git repository.


This central repository houses all versions of the ELPA library. At
the time of this writing (11/30/2011), the ELPA developers provide two
separate versions, each as a separate subdirectory available here:

- ELPA_2011.12

  This is a stable version of the entire ELPA library including all
  necessary files to build it. When using ELPA for production, we
  recommend using this version, as it has seen a lot of testing and
  production use. 

  This version should only ever see any updates if there are clear and
  unambiguous bug-fixes to be made. Each bugfix must be documented in
  the README file. (At the time of this writing, no known bugs exist.)


- ELPA_development_version

  This is the development version of the ELPA library. Any useful new
  changes should be made here, and a number of changes will be made in
  the near future. If you want the version presently "branded" as
  stable, please refer to ELPA_2011.12 at this time. 


ELPA Version numbering scheme:

We have decided to use the format "ELPA_year.month" to designate
specific stable point releases of the ELPA library. Point releases
will be made at irregular intervals, solely determined by when we
consider the development version absolutely stable. At the time of the
"branching", the new stable version should be an exact copy of the
development one.
